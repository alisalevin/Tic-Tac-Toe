Files
TicTacToe.java – has the minimax algorithm and entire game set up 
PlayGame.java – driver program that introduces and begins the game 


Note: If you want to run these programs through the terminal and wish to compile both java files at once, make sure both files are in the same directory, get into that directory, and type "javac *.java"
Otherwise, you can compile each file separately as described below. 

1. First compile the TicTacToe file in the terminal by typing "javac TicTacToe.java"
2. Then compile the PlayGame file in the terminal by typing "javac PlayGame.java"
3. To begin the game, type "java PlayGame" 
4. You will be prompted to enter your move. Enter an integer 1-9 to start the game.
